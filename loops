JavaScript Loops – Detailed Theory Notes
1) Introduction to Loops

Loops are control flow statements used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition becomes false. They help reduce code repetition and make programs more efficient and readable.

In JavaScript, loops are mainly used for:

Repeating tasks

Traversing arrays and objects

Processing data

Automating calculations

2) Why Loops are Important

Without loops, we would need to write the same code many times.

Example without loop:

console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);


With loop:

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}


Loops save time, reduce code length, and make programs easier to manage.

3) Types of Loops in JavaScript
A) for Loop (Entry-Controlled Loop)

The condition is checked before executing the loop body.

Structure:

for (initialization; condition; update) {
   // code block
}


Working:

Initialization runs once.

Condition is checked.

If true → code runs.

Update changes the variable.

Condition checked again.

Use Case:

When number of repetitions is known.

B) while Loop (Entry-Controlled Loop)

The loop runs as long as the condition remains true.

Structure:

while (condition) {
   // code
}


Working:

First checks condition.

If true → executes code.

Repeats until condition becomes false.

Use Case:

When number of repetitions is not known.

C) do...while Loop (Exit-Controlled Loop)

This loop executes the code first and checks the condition later.

Structure:

do {
   // code
} while (condition);


Key Feature:

Runs at least once even if the condition is false.

Use Case:

When the code must execute at least one time.

D) for...in Loop

Used to iterate over object properties (keys).

Important Points:

Works with objects

Returns keys/indexes

Use Case:

Reading object data

E) for...of Loop

Used to iterate over iterable elements like:

Arrays

Strings

Maps

Sets

Important Points:

Returns values directly

Easier than normal for loop for arrays

4) Entry-Controlled vs Exit-Controlled Loops
Type	Condition Check	Example
Entry-Controlled	Before execution	for, while
Exit-Controlled	After execution	do...while
5) Infinite Loop

A loop that never stops because the condition never becomes false.

Example:

while (true) {
  console.log("Hello");
}


Reason:

Missing update statement

Always true condition

6) Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

Example:

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
    console.log(i, j);
  }
}


Use Case:

Pattern printing

Matrix operations

7) Loop Control Statements
break

Immediately stops the loop.

continue

Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

8) Difference Between for, while, and do...while
Feature	for	while	do...while
Condition Check	Before	Before	After
Minimum Execution	0	0	1
Best For	Known count	Unknown count	Must run once
9) Performance Consideration

for loop is faster for arrays.

for...of is cleaner and readable.

Avoid infinite loops to prevent system crash.

10) Real-Life Examples of Loops

Showing numbers 1 to 100

Checking items in a shopping cart

Reading student marks

Running a game until player loses

11) Summary

Loops are one of the most important concepts in JavaScript. They help in repeating tasks, processing large data, and writing efficient code. Choosing the correct loop depends on the problem, condition, and data type.
